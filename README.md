# Django App Boilerplate

Django app boilerplate is a template for a Django app to start quickly, simply, and with least repetition. The purpose of this project is to provide the optimal amount of code - not too much, not too little - so that one could start building an app at your existing Django project as soon as possible.

You can start a new Django app with:

```
$ django-admin.py startapp --template=https://github.com/archatas/django-app-boilerplate/archive/master.zip app_name
```

Or start a new Django CMS app with:

```
$ django-admin.py startapp --template=https://github.com/archatas/django-app-boilerplate/archive/djangocms.zip app_name
```

Then do a global search for "My App", "MyApp", "My Model", "My Models", "MyModel", "mymodel", "My Plugin", "My Plugin Model", "MyPluginModel", and "my\_plugin_model", and replace them with what you need there. Delete any unnecessary files.
